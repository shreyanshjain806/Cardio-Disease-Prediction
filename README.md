# Cardio-Disease-Prediction
We thus aim to promote prevention of disease and help patients to  understand their physiology.
- Design and implementation of various advanced machine learning 
techniques to predict heart disease present in a person
- The algorithms implemented are logistic regression model, decision 
tree, random forest, single layer neural network, SVM and K nearest 
neighbour.
- To present a comparative study of the machine learning algorithms by 
analysing the performance metrics.
-The proposed work predicts the chances of heart disease and 
classifies patientâ€™s risk level by implementing different basic and advanced 
regression ML techniques.
